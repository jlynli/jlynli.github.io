    <p class="instructions">click on the bird, sun, or heart to navigate to each page <br><br> For this project, I created original drawings externally through a drawing program and then elevated them using code. Each page works with the idea of flowers in spring, using CSS animation to slightly animate a lot of the elements on each page so the flowers look like they were being affected by a spring breeze in all three pages. I want these pages to be relaxing for users to interact with and have a cute and colorful aesthetic that matches my art style. I hope all three pages feel refreshing like a spring breeze. </p>
