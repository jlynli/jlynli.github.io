                As a game design student, I have experience with many facets of making games including designing, coding, and creating assets. I have used game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and even Gamemaker. A few of the games I've made can be previewed on this page or seen directly on <a href="https://lichirin.itch.io/" target="_blank" class="inParagraphLink" style="color: rgb(209,32,47);">my itch.io page.</a> This page also includes examples of design documents and concept pitches I've worked on as well!

                <br><br>
                The game is set in a Regency Period inspired tea party where the main character and four other ladies discuss and gossip about the scandalous events of a party the night prior.

                A redesign for the game <a href="https://lichirin.itch.io/tea-party" target="_blank" class="inParagraphLink" style="color: rgb(209,32,47);">"Tea Party"</a>'s UI/UX. This redesign was focused on addressing problems in the original UI regarding a lack of clarity and to improve the game's visual aesthetic. 
                I decided to redesign the UI with these key
                points in mind: the redesign must improve clarity, improve and deepen the game’s
                aesthetics, and still be comfortable to look at. Focusing on these key aspects, I did an
                extensive redesign going through an audit, wireframe, mockup, prototype, and several
                user response surveys. 
                <br><br>
                You can view and read more in-depth about this redesign to the right! When I get the time, I will be fully implementing this design into the game's build but for now, you can experience the redesign for yourself <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/87d4342e-7599-46ed-96ed-43a204b3435c-d287/?fullscreen&hints=off" target="_blank" class="inParagraphLink" style="color: rgb(209,32,47);">here!</a>

            each window is too big for all the windows to fit on the game screen without overlapping so the player must also be mechanically precise with dragging and reordering them. These 
            factors combine to create a slightly stressful situation for the player.

             the players should be deriving from it. My teammates and I wanted the player to feel interested in the ghost's stories and lonely when they had to leave and, through the game's mechanics, tried to solve the problem of

                            Because the game is mechanically simple and players come up with their own explanations for
                            scenarios that occur, a unique storyline is able to emerge with each playthrough.

The original assignment was to clone a card game with the same mechanics and then to add one new mechanic, new graphics, and polish.
                <br><br>
                The game has the player play a version of Rock Paper Scissors with playing cards against a simple AI dealer. There are three phases in the game: betting, playing, and revealing. The player must bet ingame currency during the betting phase, play one of three random cards in the play phase, and on the reveal phase, the player either loses or gains money based on the outcome of their card versus the dealer's card. There are two endings in this game based on whether the player has gone bankrupt or the dealer loses all their money.
